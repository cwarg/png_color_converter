# png_color_converter

Translates the colors of a given png to a different hue, while retaining the saturation and lightness. Original purpose for this project was to convert Minecraft textures from one color to another such as creating a ruby from a sapphire texture.

## Examples
![](./resources/sapphire.png) -> ![](./resources/ruby.png)\
![](./resources/sapphire.png) -> ![](./resources/emerald.png)\
![](./resources/sapphire.png) -> ![](./resources/amethyst.png)
